I created this for learning about login authentication in Node.js. On every commit I tested out a different security method. The ones I tried are:

1. Password encription with mongoose-encryption.
2. Hashing with md5
3. Salting with bcrypt
4. Cookies and sessions with password, password-local and password-local-mongoose
5. Third party authentication with OAuth 2.0 (Google and Facebook)
